# About me

## Marcos Marina LÃ³pez
I am a .NET Programmer specialized in analysis, design and optimization of applications in BackEnd enviroments.
I have been working with high intensive algorithms and processes, using virtual Windows machines as well as Docker and Kubernetes, in order to process large amount of data in a like-Big-Data approach. However, I have seen that all of this is not enough to work in a real Big Data world and to take advantage over competitors and to grow up. For that reason, I am learning all I can to become an specialist in Data Science field... and because I like it too much, I guess :smiley:

## How did I get here?
Well, I studied Technical Engineer of Topography in Madrid, but the 2008 crisis hit me as well as other people... So, it was the turn of reinventing myself and I started to learn programming. I was hired in a marketing analyst company where I have grown a lot, but I think I am able to do a better work and to develop better products if I would have more knowledge in Data Science. In the same way, it is a field that I feel confortable with and I want to learn much more about it.


## Hobbies
I play the guitar in "Father and Clonpany" cover band (I will confess why this name, but not now) and also I sing too.
I like taking a walk with my dog in nature.
I really like boardgames!
I love visiting cities and museums.
I enjoy coding!
